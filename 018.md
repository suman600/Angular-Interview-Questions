# What are detached change detectors, and how do they improve performance

A **detached change detector** refers to manually disconnecting Angular‚Äôs change detection from a component or a subtree. Once detached, Angular **won‚Äôt automatically check for changes** in that part during its normal cycle.

### Why Detach?
To **boost performance** by skipping unnecessary checks ‚Äî ideal for:

- Static or rarely changing content.
- Large components where updates are controlled.
- Custom rendering or manual update control.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è How to Detach and Reattach

```ts
import { ChangeDetectorRef } from '@angular/core';

constructor(private cdr: ChangeDetectorRef) {}

ngOnInit() {
  this.cdr.detach(); // Stops automatic change detection
}

someManualUpdate() {
  // Perform manual update
  this.cdr.detectChanges(); // Manually trigger change detection
}
```

---

### Use Case Example
Imagine a component that displays thousands of items but only needs to update when a user clicks a button. Instead of Angular running change detection on every app event:

1. Use `cdr.detach()` to skip auto checks.
2. Call `cdr.detectChanges()` only when the data really changes.
