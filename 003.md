# Angular Modules (@NgModule)

In Angular, the **@NgModule** is a decorator, **ngModule** groups of features, components, directives, and pipes within a module. It plays a key role in structuring the project by organizing related functionalities, ensuring better maintainability, scalability, and modularity of the application.

### Importance of Angular Modules

1. **Modularity**:  
   Angular modules help in dividing the application into smaller, logical pieces, making it easier to manage and scale the codebase.

2. **Lazy Loading**:  
   Modules allow for lazy loading, meaning only the necessary parts of the application are loaded initially, improving performance.

3. **Code Reusability**:  
   By organizing code into modules, Angular promotes reusability across different parts of the application.

4. **Dependency Injection**:  
   Modules provide a context for Angularâ€™s dependency injection system, which efficiently manages services and their dependencies.

5. **Collaboration**:  
   Modules allow different teams to work on different parts of the application simultaneously, making development more efficient.

### Example: Basic Angular Module

```typescript
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { CommonModule } from '@angular/common';
import { AppComponent } from './app.component';

@NgModule({
  declarations: [AppComponent],  // Components, Directives, Pipes
  imports: [CommonModule],      // Other modules to import
  providers: [],                // Services to be injected
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]      // Root component for bootstrapping
})
export class AppModule { }
