## What Are Angular Templates, and How Do They Work?

In Angular, **templates** are HTML files that define the view for a component. These templates allow dynamic rendering of the user interface (UI) by binding data from the component to the HTML structure. They are a key part of Angular's **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** architecture, where the **view** is the template that displays data and interacts with the user.

## How Do Angular Templates Work?

1. **Data Binding**:  
   Angular templates use **data binding** to dynamically display data from the component:
   - **Interpolation**: `{{ expression }}` – Displays component data in the template.
   - **Property Binding**: `[property]="expression"` – Binds component properties to HTML element properties.
   - **Event Binding**: `(event)="method()"` – Binds events (like clicks) to component methods.
   - **Two-Way Binding**: `[(ngModel)]="property"` – Synchronizes data between the component and the view.

2. **Directives**:  
   Templates make use of **directives** to add behavior to the DOM. These include:
   - **Structural Directives**: e.g., `*ngIf`, `*ngFor` – Modify the structure of the DOM by adding or removing elements.
   - **Attribute Directives**: e.g., `ngClass`, `ngStyle` – Modify the appearance or behavior of elements.

3. **Pipes**:  
   Angular templates can use **pipes** to transform data before it is displayed in the view. For example, the **`date`** pipe formats a date, and the **`currency`** pipe formats numbers as currency.

4. **Component Templates**:  
   Every component in Angular has a template that defines how its UI should look. The template can either be inline (defined within the component itself) or external (linked through an HTML file).

## Example: Angular Template with Data Binding and Directives

```html
<div *ngIf="isLoggedIn">
  <h1>Welcome, {{ username }}!</h1>
  <button (click)="logout()">Logout</button>
</div>
<div *ngIf="!isLoggedIn">
  <h1>Please Log In</h1>
  <button (click)="login()">Login</button>
</div>
