## Question
What are the key differences between Angular and AngularJS?

## Angular
Angular is a **TypeScript-based front-end framework** developed and maintained by Google. It is a complete rewrite of AngularJS and is designed for building **scalable, modular, and high-performance** single-page applications (SPAs).

## AngularJS
AngularJS (or Angular 1.x) is the **original version** of Angular, built using **JavaScript**. It was popular for its **two-way data binding**, **dependency injection**, and **directives**, but it had limitations in performance, maintainability, and scalability.

## Key Differences Between Angular and AngularJS

| Feature       | AngularJS (1.x) | Angular (2+) |
|--------------|----------------|-------------|
| **Architecture** | MVC (Model-View-Controller) | Component-Based |
| **Language** | JavaScript | TypeScript (strict superset of JavaScript) |
| **Data Binding** | Two-way binding (default) | Two-way, but default is unidirectional (better performance) |
| **Performance** | Slower due to digest cycle | Faster with change detection using Zone.js |
| **Directives** | Built-in directives like `ng-model`, `ng-bind` | Component-based directives (`@Component`, `@Directive`) |
| **Dependency Injection (DI)** | Limited support | Advanced DI system |
| **Mobile Support** | Not optimized for mobile | Mobile-first design |
| **Routing** | `$routeProvider` (basic) | Angular Router (powerful, lazy-loading support) |
| **Backward Compatibility** | Not compatible with Angular 2+ | Supports upgrades via `ngUpgrade` |

## When to Use Angular Instead of AngularJS?
âœ… If you are working on a new project, **always go with Angular (2+)** because:

- **Better performance** due to Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilation.
- **Modular architecture** with reusable components.
- **Strong TypeScript support** for maintainability.
- **Improved testing and tooling** (CLI, Ivy Renderer).
- **Active support from Google** (AngularJS is now deprecated).
