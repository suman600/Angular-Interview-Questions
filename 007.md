# **Difference Between Declarative and Imperative Programming in Angular**

## **Description**
Angular primarily follows **declarative programming**, but also allows **imperative programming** when needed.

## **Comparison Table**

| Approach          | Declarative Programming | Imperative Programming |
|------------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| **Definition**    | Describes *what* should happen. | Defines *how* things should happen step-by-step. |
| **Usage in Angular** | Used in **HTML templates** with directives like `*ngIf`, `*ngFor`, and data binding. | Used in **TypeScript code** for event handling, service calls, and DOM manipulation. |
| **Example**       | `<div *ngIf="isVisible">Visible Content</div>` (Angular decides when to show it) | `if (isVisible) { divElement.style.display = 'block'; }` (Manually controlling visibility) |
| **Readability**   | More readable, less code | More detailed, explicit control |
| **Flexibility**   | Suitable for UI rendering and binding | Useful for complex logic and side effects |

## **Conclusion**
- **Declarative** programming makes Angular templates cleaner and easier to maintain.
- **Imperative** programming is necessary for direct control over application behavior.
- Angular combines both approaches for an optimal development experience.
