# Angular Lifecycle Hooks - Notes

## Description

Angular lifecycle hooks are predefined methods that Angular calls at specific stages of a component or directive's lifecycle. These hooks allow developers to manage data flows, DOM rendering, subscriptions, and resource cleanup effectively.

## Lifecycle Hook Execution Order and Use Cases

1. **`ngOnChanges()`**

    - **When**: Called when any data-bound input property changes.
    - **Use Case**: React to input changes from a parent component, like updating UI or calling functions.

2. **`ngOnInit()`**

    - **When**: Called once after the first`ngOnChanges()`
    - **Use Case**: Initialize data from services, fetch API data, or set up internal state.

3. **`ngDoCheck()`**

    - **When**: Called during every change detection run.
    - **Use Case**: Implement custom change detection when Angular’s default isn’t enough.

4. **`ngAfterContentInit()`**

    - **When**: Called once after Angular projects external content (`<ng-content>`).
    - **Use Case**: Interact with projected content from a parent component.

5. **`ngAfterContentChecked()`**

    - **When**: Called after every check of the projected content.
    - **Use Case**: Respond to changes in the projected content.

6. **`ngAfterViewInit()`**

    - **When**: Called once after the component’s view and child views are initialized.
    - **Use Case**: Access child component instances or manipulate the DOM.

7. **`ngAfterViewChecked()`**

    - **When**: Called after every check of the component’s view and child views.
    - **Use Case**: Trigger logic based on updates in the view tree.

8. **`ngOnDestroy()`**

    - **When**: Called just before the component is destroyed.
    - **Use Case**: Unsubscribe from Observables, clear intervals/timeouts, detach event handlers to avoid memory leaks.

## Notes for Interview

- Lifecycle hooks give precise control over a component’s behavior across its lifespan.
- `ngOnInit()` is essential for performing setup tasks, especially in services-driven apps.
- Always perform cleanup in `ngOnDestroy()`.
- Avoid heavy logic inside `ngDoCheck()` due to performance concerns.
- DOM-related tasks should be placed in `ngAfterViewInit()`.

## Example:

```ts
import { Component, OnInit, OnDestroy } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-sample',
  template: `<p>{{ message }}</p>`
})
export class SampleComponent implements OnInit, OnDestroy {
  message = 'Hello';

  ngOnInit() {
    console.log('Component Initialized');
  }

  ngOnDestroy() {
    console.log('Component Destroyed');
  }
}
```
