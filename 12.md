# What is the difference between ngOnInit and ngOnChanges?

âœ… **ngOnInit**  
Runs **once** after the component is initialized and inputs are set.  
Use it to fetch data, initialize defaults, or setup services.

âœ… **ngOnChanges**  
Runs **every time** an `@Input()` property changes.  
Use it to respond to input changes from a parent component.
