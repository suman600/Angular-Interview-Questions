# **What is TypeScript, and why does Angular use it?**

**TypeScript** is a superset of JavaScript that introduces static typing, modern JavaScript features, and enhanced tooling support. It is compiled into plain JavaScript that runs in any browser.

### **Why does Angular use TypeScript?**

1. **Static Typing:** TypeScript’s type-checking helps catch errors at compile-time, reducing runtime bugs.
2. **Enhanced Tooling:** Angular benefits from better autocompletion, error checking, and refactoring tools.
3. **OOP Features:** TypeScript supports classes, interfaces, and inheritance, allowing more structured and modular Angular code.
4. **Modern JavaScript:** Angular uses TypeScript to implement ES6/ES7 features like async/await, classes, and modules.
5. **Seamless Integration:** Angular’s CLI and core libraries are designed to work optimally with TypeScript.

### **Conclusion:**
Angular uses TypeScript to improve code quality, scalability, and developer productivity through static typing, modern features, and better tooling.
