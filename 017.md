# How to Manually Trigger Change Detection

In Angular, you can manually trigger change detection using the `ChangeDetectorRef` service. Normally, Angular automatically runs change detection when component data changes, but there are cases where Angular might not be aware of changes, especially when they occur outside its zone (like asynchronous operations or third-party libraries). In such cases, you can manually trigger change detection to update the view.

1. **Import `ChangeDetectorRef`**:
   To trigger change detection, you need to import `ChangeDetectorRef` from `@angular/core`.

   ```ts
   import { ChangeDetectorRef } from '@angular/core';
   ```

2. **Inject `ChangeDetectorRef` in the Component**:
   Inject the `ChangeDetectorRef` service into the component's constructor.

   ```ts
   constructor(private cdr: ChangeDetectorRef) {}
   ```

3. **Use `detectChanges()`**:
   The `detectChanges()` method manually triggers the change detection process, which will check the component's view and its children for changes.

   ```ts
   this.cdr.detectChanges();
   ```

### Use Cases for `detectChanges()`

1. **Asynchronous Operations Outside Angular's Zone**:
   If you perform an asynchronous task like a `setTimeout`, `setInterval`, or third-party library callback that updates data, Angular might not detect the changes automatically. You can manually trigger change detection to update the view.

   Example:
   ```ts
   setTimeout(() => {
     this.message = 'Data Loaded';
     this.cdr.detectChanges(); // Manually trigger change detection
   }, 2000);
   ```

2. **Handling External Events**:
   When you handle events like WebSocket messages, custom events, or third-party library events, Angular may not automatically detect data changes. You can use `detectChanges()` to manually update the UI.

   Example:
   ```ts
   this.socketService.onMessageReceived().subscribe((data) => {
     this.message = data;
     this.cdr.detectChanges(); // Manually trigger change detection
   });
   ```

3. **Direct DOM Manipulation**:
   If you're manipulating the DOM directly (e.g., with jQuery or third-party libraries), Angular may not be aware of the changes. Using `detectChanges()` can ensure the view is updated to reflect the changes.

   Example:
   ```ts
   someThirdPartyLibrary.onEvent(() => {
     this.someData = 'Updated by third-party library';
     this.cdr.detectChanges(); // Manually trigger change detection
   });
   ```
